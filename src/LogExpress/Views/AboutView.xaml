          A log-file is something that most software write to using a "logging" tool, i.e: NLog, SeriLog, log4net, EntLib. LogExpress is designed to help navigate logs created by any of these libraries, but it does expect eash log-entry to contain a timestamp and a severity. 
        </TextBlock>
        <TextBlock>
          It is not unusual for a log-entry to contain newline characters. LogExpert deals with these lines by giving them the same timestamp and severity as the last logged entry. If the first file in the set starts with no timestamp or severity, then it is given the same timestamp as the file itself, and the severity is set to 0 (although this might not necessarily be correct. We believe that the scenarios for a log-file to start with empty lines to be extremely unusual though, as the loggers writing the log-entries normally flush after a full entry.

        <TextBlock FontWeight="Bold" FontStyle="Italic">
          LogExpert expects the timstamp start-column, length and format as well as the severity-list and start-column to be consistent in all files that are part in the set to be opened.
